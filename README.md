# ChatterBox
"Imagine a cozy chat room brought to life with Python magic and Socket programming. It's not just any chat appâ€”it effortlessly juggles multiple rooms and even has clever bots to lend a hand. Plus, we've added an extra layer of security with OpenSSL, so now it's HTTPS all the way for safe and sound chatting."
